**Changed Properties**
- ALL properties from ALL jobs in this release have had their namespaces removed.
  The `cf_networking.<job_name>` prefixes are no longer necessary given bosh supports job level properties.
- Removed `policy-server-internal.tag_length` property from `policy-server-internal` job, this property is retrieved via bosh links from
  `tag_length is used by link to policy-server.tag_length`.
- To support third party integrators we have changed the cni job in `silk-release` to `silk-cni`
  - To continue using `silk` the `cni_plugin_dir` and `cni_config_dir` on the `garden-cni`
    job must be explicitly set in the manifest as follows:
    - `cni_plugin_dir: /var/vcap/packages/silk-cni/bin`
    - `cni_config_dir: /var/vcap/jobs/silk-cni/config/cni`
  - Third party integrators should continue using the default values for these properties
- `connect_timeout_seconds` on the `policy-server` and `policy-server-internal` jobs now affects
  how long it takes for a db connection to be established when the policy server starts. Before
  this was hardcoded to a timeout of 5 seconds.

### 2.0.0 Silk-Release
**New Properties**
  - An optional parameter `no_masquerade_cidr_range` has been added to the `silk-cni` job to specify which destination
    CIDR to exempt MASQUERADEing traffic from containers.
    If this is left unset and the bosh link `cf_network` is available with the property `network` set, it will use that value.
    Otherwise, an empty default value will be applied. If empty it will not exclude any ranges.
  - Add `disable` property to all jobs. When it is set to true the job will not start.
  - To support third party integrators we have changed the `cni` job in `silk-release` to `silk-cni`
    - To continue using `silk` the `cni_plugin_dir` and `cni_config_dir` on the `garden-cni`

### 1.4.0 CF-Networking-Release
**Links Enabled**
The `silk-controller` job now provides two properties via links which the `silk-daemon` job consumes:

- `cf_networking.network`
- `cf_networking.subnet_prefix_length`
** This means you are able to remove the properties (listed above) from the `silk-daemon` job. **

If your deployment contains more than a single instance group that has the `silk-controller` job,
then you will need to explicitly name the `cf_network` link. For more information,
[see the documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/links.html#deployment).

**New Properties**
  - An optional parameter has been added to configure the port of the metron agent for
    the iptables_logger. This port will be used to forward metrics. Previously, no such
    port existed.

### 1.3.0 CF-Networking-Release

**New Properties**
  - An optional parameter has been added to configure the rate of logs by
    iptables for accepted UDP packets. Before, logging was done per UDP
    connection. Now, the rate defaults to 100 packets per second.
    - `cf_networking.iptables_accepted_udp_logs_per_sec` is the maximum number of
      accepted udp packets logged by iptables per second, it should be
      configured on the `silk-cni` job for ASGs or on the `vxlan-policy-agent`
      job for C2C.

### 1.2.0 CF-Networking-Release

**New Properties**

  - Optional parameters have been added to the `silk-cni` job to limit the
    bandwidth in and out of containers.
    - `cf_networking.rate` is the rate in Kbps at which traffic can leave and
      enter a container.
    - `cf_networking.burst` is the burst in Kb at which traffic can leave and
      enter a container.
    - Both of these parameters must be set in order to limit bandwidth. If
      neither one is set, then bandwidth is not limited.
    - The burst must high enough to support the given rate. If burst is not
      high enough, then creating containers will fail.
  - An optional parameter has been added to configure the rate of logs by
    iptables for denied packets. Before, this rate was hardcoded to 2 packets
    per minute. Now, the rate defaults to 1 packet per second.
    - `cf_networking.iptables_denied_logs_per_sec` is the maximum number of
      denied packets logged by iptables per second, it should be configured on
      the `silk-cni` job.

### 1.1.0 CF-Networking-Release

    - `cf_networking.max_policies_per_app_source`
    
### 1.0.0 CF-Networking-Release

**New Properties**

  - The following optional parameters have been added to override the timeout values for
    database connections and DNS health checks for the silk controller and policy server:
    - `cf_networking.silk_controller.connect_timeout_seconds`
    - `cf_networking.policy_server.connect_timeout_seconds`

  - This optional property has been added to override the metron port on the silk controller:
    - `cf_networking.silk_controller.metron_port`

  - This optional property has been added to override the health check port on the silk controller:
    - `cf_networking.silk_controller.health_check_port`

**Removed Properties**

  - The following properties have been removed from the silk-controller job,
    **but still must be set on the silk-daemon job**.
    -  `cf_networking.silk_daemon.ca_cert`
    -  `cf_networking.silk_daemon.client_cert`
    -  `cf_networking.silk_daemon.client_key`

### 0.25.0 CF-Networking-Release

**New Properties**

  - The optional parameter `cf_networking.lease_poll_interval_seconds` has been added to allow
    operators to override the default polling interval between silk-daemon and silk-controller.

**Changed Properties**

  - The value for `cf_networking.garden_external_networker.cni_config_dir` now defaults to `/var/vcap/jobs/silk-cni/config/cni`
    We recommend that you remove any overrides for this property, unless you are intending to use a 3rd party CNI plugin.

**Other Changes**

Since silk is now deployed by default, there is no more `silk.yml` ops file.  Deploying with flannel is no longer supported.

### 0.24.0 CF-Networking-Release

**New Properties**

The host port for receiving VXLAN packets is now configurable as `cf_networking.vtep_port` for flannel and silk.
Overriding this value is optional.

### 0.22.0 CF-Networking-Release

This release introduces a new container networking fabric called "silk" and
**contains significant changes to job and property names**.
Silk will become the default networking fabric in our next release.

Silk is a replacement for flannel, which uses a central controller node backed a SQL database.
Etcd is no longer required by CF Networking Release when running Silk.

When deploying with Silk, the following new jobs will be added:

- On the Diego cells: `silk-cni` and `silk-daemon`
- On the Diego BBS VM: `silk-controller`

These jobs require new certificates and a new (logical) database (separate from the policy server database).

We recommend you review the [spec files for these new jobs](../jobs) and the diff below.

The `cni-flannel` job will no longer be running on Diego cells.

To deploy Silk with [CF Deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment), use the
[`silk.yml` opsfile](../manifest-generation/opsfiles/silk.yml) as documented for [GCP, AWS and BOSH-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment).

Instructions for deploying with CF Release have also been updated in the above docs.  Your stub file
should have a diff that resembles:

### 0.21.0 CF-Networking-Release

**Changed Properties**

  - The value for `cf_networking.garden_external_networker.cni_plugin_dir` now defaults to `/var/vcap/packages/silk-cni/bin`
    We recommend that you remove any overrides for this property, unless you are intending to use a 3rd party CNI plugin.

### 0.20.0 CF-Networking-Release

**Changed Properties**

  - The value for `cf_networking.garden_external_networker.cni_plugin_dir` now defaults to `/var/vcap/packages/silk/bin`
    We recommend that you remove any overrides for this property, unless you are intending to use a 3rd party CNI plugin.

### 0.19.0 CF-Networking-Release

**Changed Properties**

  - The value for `cf_networking.garden_external_networker.cni_plugin_dir` **must** be updated to `/var/vcap/packages/silk/bin`
    if you are not swapping out CNI with your own plugin. (There is no default currently, but we plan to add one in the next release)
  - The property for global ASG logging has changed from `cf_networking.garden_external_networker.iptables_asg_logging`
    to `cf_networking.iptables_asg_logging`.

**Removed Properties**

 - `cf_networking.flannel_watchdog.no_bridge` is now removed.

**New Properties**

A new property `dns_servers` has been added to enable upcoming BOSH DNS support for app containers.
The servers (specified as a list of strings) will be used to populate the `/etc/resolv.conf` file in
the container.  To use this feature, operators must be using garden-runc-release version >= 1.4.0.
Set

- `cni-flannel` job, with property `cf_networking.dns_servers`

For example:
```yaml
cf_networking:
   dns_servers:
      - 169.254.0.2
```

If a link-local address is specified (as in the example above), the iptables on the host will
be modified to allow the container to access that address.

If this property is not set (or left with its default value of `[]`) then Garden-runC will set the list
based on its own BOSH properties.  By default, the DNS servers from the host are used.


### 0.18.0 CF-Networking-Release

**New Properties**

  - `cf_networking.rep_listen_addr_admin` enables our drain scripts to wait for the Diego rep to exit.
  It should always be the same value as `diego.rep.listen_addr_admin`. It defaults to `127.0.0.1:1800`.
  - `cf_networking.garden_external_networker.iptables_asg_logging` globally enables iptables logging for
    all ASGs, including logging of denied packets. Defaults to false.
  - `cf_networking.vxlan_policy_agent.iptables_c2c_logging` enables iptables logging for
  container-to-container traffic.  It defaults to `false`. *Note: this is already
  [configurable at runtime](troubleshooting.md#enabling-iptables-logging-for-container-to-container-traffic).*
  - `cf_networking.plugin.health_check_port` allows BOSH to better health-check the `flanneld` process
  required for connectivity.

**Removed Properties**

 - `cf_networking.policy_server.database.connection_string` was deprecated in v0.10.0 and is now removed.

### 0.17.0 CF-Networking-Release
Policy server requires a CA cert for UAA, **manifest must be generated with `diego-release` v1.7.0+**

The following needs to be added to your `cf-networking` stub **even if you are skipping ssl validation of UAA**:

```diff
cf_networking_overrides:
  properties:
    cf_networking:
      policy_server:
+      uaa_ca: (( config_from_cf.uaa.ca_cert ))
```

### 0.15.0 CF-Networking-Release

**Many breaking changes!**

0. Requires Diego Release v1.6.2 or higher

0. Release name changed from `netman` to `cf-networking`

0. Acceptance errand name changed from `netman-cf-acceptance` to `cf-networking-acceptance`

0. All propeties of `cf-networking-release` jobs live under a global `properties.cf_networking` key e.g:

  ```diff
     properties:
  +    cf_networking:
  +      ...
  ```

0. Several references to jobs in properties have changed names:

  ```diff
     properties:
  +    cf_networking:
  -      policy-server:
  +      policy_server:
           ...
  -      vxlan-policy-agent:
  +      vxlan_policy_agent:
           ...
  -      cni-flannel:
  +      plugin:
           ...
  -      garden-cni:
  +      garden_external_networker:
           ...
  +      ...
  ```

0. `properties.netman.disable` renamed `properties.cf_networking.disable`

0. `flannel.etcd.require_ssl` property has been completely removed.
Previously it defaulted to `true` but could be overridden to `false`.
Now SSL is required for the flannel connection to etcd.
Refer to the [cf-deployment docs](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment)
for details on how to generate and configure certs and keys.
Note, you will likely need to make similar changes to other etcd clients, e.g. loggregator.

0. In the stub file, `netman_overrides` renamed to `cf_networking_overrides`

### 0.12.0 CF-Networking-Release

In the CF properties stub:

```diff
    -   scope: cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller.write,openid,password.write,cloud_controller.admin,scim.read,scim.write,doppler.firehose,uaa.user,routing.router_groups.read,network.admin
    +   scope: cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller.write,openid,password.write,cloud_controller.admin,scim.read,scim.write,doppler.firehose,uaa.user,routing.router_groups.read,network.admin,network.write
```

###  0.10.0 CF-Networking-Release
Policy Server database connection is now expressed as a set of config options, not a single connection string

In the CF Networking stub:

```diff
  policy_server:
    database:
       type: REPLACE_WITH_DB_TYPE # must be mysql or postgres
-      connection_string: postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@DB_HOSTNAME:5524/DB_NAME?sslmode=disable
+      username: REPLACE_WITH_USERNAME
+      password: REPLACE_WITH_PASSWORD
+      host: REPLACE_WITH_DB_HOSTNAME
+      port: REPLACE_WITH_DB_PORT # e.g. 3306 for mysql
